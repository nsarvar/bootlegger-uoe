**We’ve been using bootlegger in our Ubicomp third year computing science module. As part of the module students are learning how to build prototype ubicomp interactions using raspberry pi and a grove kit.**

We’re interested in how we can increase our students’ visibility with future employers, as well as provide learning materials for other people in the community interesting in computing science and are using bootlegger as a tool to help us achieve this. Over the course of the semester we’ve tasked our students with creating a set of ‘how-to’ instructional videos that other people can use to get to grips with raspberry pi using bootlegger. Each week the class work in pairs to complete a set of practical challenges with Pi, as well as to create a series of clips demonstrating what they have been doing. After the class students can then access everyone’s clips, review how other students have completed the task, or presented their work.

Through doing so they can reflect on ways of presenting technical knowledge and consider how they might improve their own skills. By choosing and structuring the clips using Bootlegger’s inbuilt editing tool students can quickly develop a short ‘how-to’ video that they can share with each other, and other interested parties. 

At the end of the module students’ submissions will be posted online as a resource that students can point to, and reuse throughout the year.
