**The Loudest Whisper was a community event that featured the world’s largest ever game of Chinese Whispers. It involved over 3000 people from the town of Stockton on Tees and ran for two days, during which the whisper passed through streets, parks, shopping centres and at one point across a river by speedboat.**

Our role was to capture the action through 6 teenage volunteers with mobile phones who would be spread out across the route. This ‘camera crew’ organised themselves, keeping up with the whisper as it moved around the town. They had to move fast and plan ahead to keep up with the action as the whisper wasn’t always between people on foot: buses, motorcycles and a vintage jeep were used to travel between the main parts of the events. The footage collected was edited into a short film that was posted online and shown at a live showcase a few hours after the end of the event.

As the editor, it was my responsibility to get the footage together and cut it into a film in a very tight timeframe. Bootlegger made it easy to collect the footage over Wi-Fi throughout the event, without having to log and back up physical memory cards, giving me a head start on the edit.

It was great to get footage that was already tagged with location, subject and crew information. As The Loudest Whisper took place over two days and featured more than ten different locations, this information was crucial in helping me work out what had occurred where, saving hours of note-taking both for me and the crew. The shot overlays showed the crew exactly the types of shots I was looking for and we got some great footage.
