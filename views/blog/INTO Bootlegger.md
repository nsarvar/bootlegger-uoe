**In the summer of 2015 we worked with a teacher and their class at INTO Newcastle University, which is a school for international students, aimed at helping them become more settled into life in Newcastle before starting their degrees.** 

The idea was to see how Bootlegger could be used in a higher education environment. Both teacher and students seemed very enthusiastic and excited at the prospect of doing something novel and using mobile phones in the classroom. 
 
We decided with the teacher that the best way to use Bootlegger in the timeframe we had was to have the students set up their own video shoots and record each other doing presentations in front of the class. So, after a short introduction to the app by their teacher, the students went away and experimented with Bootlegger at home. The next morning in class, they worked in groups to create the shoot templates. Then, in the next few days the presentations were filmed by a ‘film crew’ of 3 students, who each positioned themselves so that they’d get a variety of angles and shots.
